           <h2>Bioraphy</h2>
          <p><i>Mandela was a prominent anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as the first black president of South Africa. His life and struggle against apartheid, as well as his leadership in the post-apartheid era, make for an inspiring biography. Here is a detailed account of Nelson Mandela's life:

            Early Life:
            
            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the small village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a chief, and his mother, Nosekeni Fanny, was the third of his father's four wives.
            Education and Law Career:
            
            Mandela attended primary school in Qunu and then the Clarkebury Boarding Institute. He later enrolled at Healdtown, a prestigious Wesleyan secondary school.
            In 1941, he moved to Johannesburg to escape a forced arranged marriage and found work as a night watchman while completing his bachelor's degree by correspondence at the University of South Africa.
            Mandela pursued a law degree at the University of Witwatersrand and later studied law at the University of Fort Hare. He became a lawyer and opened a law firm with Oliver Tambo, providing legal assistance to black South Africans who were discriminated against by the apartheid regime.
            Anti-Apartheid Activism:
            
            Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1943, which was initially a non-violent organization advocating for civil rights.</i>

            Nelson Mandela Famous Sayings:
          </h2>
 <p><i><ul><li>"must be ready to sacrifice all for the freedom of their people.”<br></li>

<li><i>“A fundamental concern for others in our individual and community lives would go a long way in making the world the better place we so passionately dreamt of.”<br></li></i>
            
<li>“Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.”<br></li></i>
            
<li><i>“I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.”<br></li></i>
            
<li><i>“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”<br></li></i>
            
<li><i>“Everyone can rise above their circumstances and achieve success if they are dedicated to and passionate about what they do.”<br></li></i>
            
<li><i>“I like friends who have independent minds because they tend to make you see problems from all angles.”<br></li></i>
                    
<li><i>“It always seems impossible until it's done.”<br></li></i>
                   
<li><i>“Many people in this country have paid the price before me and many will pay the price after me.”<br></li></i>
                     
<li><i>“Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.”<br></li></i>
                     
<li><i>“Money won't create success, the freedom to make it will.”<br></li></i>
                     
<li><i>“It is in the character of growth that we should learn from both pleasant and unpleasant experiences.”<br></li></i>
                 
<li><i>“It is not our diversity which divides us; it is not our ethnicity, or religion or culture that divides us. Since we have achieved our freedom, there can only be one division amongst us: between those who cherish democracy and those who do not.”<br></li></i>
                 
<li><i>“For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.”<br></li></i>
               
<li><i>“A critical, independent and investigative press is the lifeblood of any democracy. The press must be free from state interference. It must have the economic strength to stand up to the blandishments of government officials. It must have sufficient independence from vested interests to be bold and inquiring without fear or favour. It must enjoy the protection of the constitution, so that it can protect our rights as citizens.”</i></p></ul></li></i>
